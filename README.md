This repository contains tasks completed for Week 4 of the AI/ML Internship program. The focus is on medical image classification using deep learning techniques, including:

Skin Cancer Detection: Classifying skin lesions (benign vs. malignant) using the ISIC dataset and transfer learning with ResNet50.
Pneumonia Detection: Diagnosing pneumonia from chest X-rays using the Chest X-Ray Images dataset and fine-tuning InceptionV3.
