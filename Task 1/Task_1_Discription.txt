1. Skin Cancer Detection Using CNN
Objective: Classify skin lesions into benign or malignant categories using the ISIC Skin Cancer dataset.

Steps:
Data Preprocessing:

Load Dataset: Import images from the ISIC Skin Cancer dataset.
Normalization: Convert pixel values from 0-255 range to a [0, 1] range by dividing by 255.
Resizing: Resize all images to 224x224 to ensure compatibility with pre-trained models.
Dataset Split: Split the dataset into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets.
Data Augmentation:

Apply random transformations to augment the dataset:
Random Rotation (e.g., 30Â°).
Flipping (horizontal and vertical).
Zooming (within a specified range).
Brightness Adjustment to simulate different lighting conditions.
Augmentation can help the model generalize better and prevent overfitting.
Model Development:

Pre-trained Model: Utilize a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., ResNet50 or EfficientNet) via transfer learning to extract features.
Fine-Tuning: Replace the final layer of the pre-trained model with a dense layer for binary classification (benign vs malignant).
Use a sigmoid activation function in the output layer.
Loss function: Binary Crossentropy.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer for better convergence.
Training: Train the model using the augmented training dataset.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using:
Accuracy (percentage of correct predictions).
Precision (true positives / (true positives + false positives)).
Recall (true positives / (true positives + false negatives)).
F1-Score (harmonic mean of precision and recall).
Use a confusion matrix to visualize performance.
