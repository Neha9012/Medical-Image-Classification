Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays
Objective: Classify chest X-ray images as pneumonia-positive or negative using the Chest X-Ray Images dataset.

Steps:
Data Preprocessing:

Load Dataset: Import images from the Kaggle Chest X-Ray dataset.
Normalization: Scale pixel values to [0, 1] by dividing by 255.
Resizing: Resize images to 224x224 to be compatible with CNN models.
Dataset Split: Split into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%).
Data Augmentation:

Apply augmentation techniques to improve model generalization:
Random Cropping to vary image inputs.
Rotation to simulate different patient orientations.
Histogram Equalization to normalize the image brightness for better feature extraction.
Model Development:

Pre-trained Model: Use a pre-trained model like MobileNet or InceptionV3 for transfer learning.
Fine-Tuning: Replace the final fully connected layer with a Dense layer for binary classification (pneumonia or healthy).
Use softmax activation in the output layer for multi-class classification.
Loss function: Categorical Crossentropy.
Optimizer: Adam.
Training: Train the model on the augmented dataset.
Evaluation:

Use metrics such as:
Sensitivity (True Positive Rate).
Specificity (True Negative Rate).
ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and Area Under the Curve).
Comparison: Compare results on augmented and non-augmented datasets.
